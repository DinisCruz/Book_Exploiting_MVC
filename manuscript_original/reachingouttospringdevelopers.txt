##  Reaching out to Spring Developers 

I just posted an entry on the Spring Framework forums [http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?111901-Security-Vulnerabilities-with-JPetStore-and-visualization-of-the-AutoBinding-Issues](http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?111901-Security-Vulnerabilities-with-JPetStore-and-visualization-of-the-AutoBinding-Issues) which hopefully will get some tracking from their side.

I will reach out to my contacts over there (Spring Source), but if you know somebody at SpringSource (or at a heavy user of Spring MVC) please put them in touch.

Thanks
