##  Exploiting Microsoft MVC vulnerabilities using OWASP O2 Platform 

Michael Hidalgo wrote this great article on using O2 to exploit an overposting (i.e. auto-binding) vuln in an ASP.NET MVC demo app: [Exploiting Microsoft MVC vulnerabilities using OWASP O2 Platform](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/471784/Exploiting-Microsoft-MVC-vulnerabilities-using-OWA)

As you can notice that was posted on CodeProject.com which has always been a good source of technical content for me (although not a site I would use everyday). That said, I'm starting to like the new version of [http://codeproject.com](http://codeproject.com/) and this could be a great place to post O2-related technical articles.

On the Asp.NET MVC topic, if you are interested, here are a couple related posts:

  * [Why ASP.NET MVC is 'insecure by design' , just like Spring MVC (and why SAST can help)](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/why-aspnet-mvc-is-insecure-by-design.html) 
  * [Current O2 support for analyzing Spring MVC](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/current-o2-support-for-analyzing-spring.html) 
  * ["Two Security Vulnerabilities in the Spring Framework's MVC" pdf (from 2008)](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/two-security-vulnerabilities-in-spring.html)

The next step is to see how we can write SAST rules (maybe executed by Cat.NET) to find these issues on the source code.

  


I really don't have hard numbers, but I will bet that the number of Asp.NET apps vulnerable is really high (just like what happens with the Spring Framework MVC)
