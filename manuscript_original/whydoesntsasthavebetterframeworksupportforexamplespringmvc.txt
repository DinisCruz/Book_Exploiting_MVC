##  Why doesn't SAST have better Framework support (for example Spring MVC)? 

I received this question today, and before I answered it, I was wondering if you guys wanted to have a go at it first:   
  


  


_"...I was reading over some of your blog entries, that made me thinks about the current state of SAST regarding the current frameworks._

_I've been aware for a long time that SAST do not handle properly framework-level information. In the case of Spring MVC, the tools just don't get the data flow, etc._

_

_Since you worked at Ounce before, do you know any particular reason why they didn't want to fo into that direction? I mean, this is a solvable problem (you somewhat show how to do that in O2). Even if they would need to implement new front-ends, this is still a very important task to be done if they wanted to compete directly with Fortify (especially since F. doesn't get it either)...._

  * In this (longish presentation) I also talk about some of the challenges that we have in supporting frameworks:  [http://www.slideshare.net/DinisCruz/owasp-o2-platform-november-2010](http://www.slideshare.net/DinisCruz/owasp-o2-platform-november-2010) 

What do you think?
