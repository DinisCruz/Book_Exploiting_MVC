##  Solution for fixing Spring's JPetStore AutoBinding vulnerabilities 

Here is an O2 blog post that describes my preferred solution for [Fixing one of JPetStore's AutoBinding Vulnerabilities (changing the purchase price)](http://o2platform.wordpress.com/2011/11/09/fixing-one-of-jpetstores-autobinding-vulnerabilities-changing-the-purchase-price/)  


  


I have to say that as a developer doing the code fix, it was simply amazing and very powerful to have the complete web workflow of the shopping cart available as an automated O2 script .

  


This allowed me to quickly ensure that: 

  a) the app still behaved as it should (after the fix)

  b) the vulnerabilities identified where properly fixed

  


What do you think of the solution?
