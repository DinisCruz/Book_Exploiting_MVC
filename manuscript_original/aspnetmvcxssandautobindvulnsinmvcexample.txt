##  ASP.NET MVC -- XSS and AutoBind vulns in MVC Example 

A while back (while in the middle of the research that lead to the publishing of the [Security Vulnerabilities in the Spring Framework Model View Controller](http://www.ouncelabs.com/pdf/Ounce_SpringFramework_Vulnerabilities.pdf)) I decided to check out if the (still in beta) ASP.NET MVC framework was vulnerable to it.
