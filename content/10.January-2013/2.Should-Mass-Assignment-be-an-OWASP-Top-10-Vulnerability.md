## Should Mass Assignment be an OWASP Top 10 Vulnerability?

I was just having a thread with Dave (who is working on the OWASP Top 10 2013) about the idea that [Mass Assignment](http://blog.diniscruz.com/2013/01/odata-aspnet-web-api-mass-assignment.html) vulnerabilites should be part of the next OWASP top 10, and here is his view:  

_It has to be more prevalent than other issues, plus introduce as much, or more risk. The Risk methodology in the Top 10 is very explicit._

_I just looked through ALL the stats provided as input to the OWASP Top 10 for 2013 and I find zero mention of AutoBinding or Mass Assignment._

_I know Aspect has found some of these vulns, in the past few years, but we are talking about a handful that we've found out of 1000s of issues total._

_Clickjacking hasn't even made it into the Top 10 and its way more prevalent, I assume._

_That said, doesn't mean we can't start some kind of awareness campaign at OWASP about new issues like Mass Assignment and Expression Language Injection, and anything else new/cool you are aware of._

_1st steps would be to create an article about each vulnerability, and then get the code review and testing guides to cover those topics, and also maybe a Prevention Cheat Sheet for each too. The article and Cheat Sheet are the easiest things to knock out first._

My view is that it should be in the next OWASP Top 10,  so I guess we need to start adding info about this vulnerability to the guides and cheat sheets :)

I will also help if we have data about how big this issue is, namely how many apps are vulnerable to it.
