## OData ASP.NET Web API: An Mass Assignment vulnerability in the making?

When I saw [Getting started with OData services in ASP.NET Web API](http://www.piotrwalat.net/getting-started-with-odata-services-in-asp-net-web-api/) (via [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/171rrx/getting_started_with_odata_services_in_aspnet_web/)) :

I immediately thought **Mass Assignment Vulnerability!**  

The part that raised my alarm was:

and

There are no mentions in that article of the words 'security' or 'mass assignment' so I wonder how much awareness there is for this issue?

**Anybody has cycles to test it out?**  

Is there any documentation for the OData ASP.NET Web API on this topic?

I couldn't find any references in [OData in WebAPI -- RC release](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/alexj/archive/2012/12/07/odata-in-webapi-rc-release.aspx) and [OData support in ASP.NET Web API](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/alexj/archive/2012/08/15/odata-support-in-asp-net-web-api.aspx)
