## Why ASP.NET MVC is 'insecure by design' , just like Spring MVC (and why SAST can help)

In the recent [Secure coding (and Application Security) must be invisible to developers](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/secure-coding-and-application-security.html) post Joshbw posted this great comment on the reasons why we end up with 'insecure by default Frameworks'

  


_'...On top of that the frameworks are being developed with the same mindset of all of the other products out there - "What makes the customer happy first, and then maybe if security doesn't interfere with that". **A great example is that MVCs really should employ declaritive binding rather than auto binding; **it really is a marginal hit to development and ensures that the only fields that can be set are those explicitely exposed by the dev. **Despite this problem being known for years even MS has taken the stance that devs should opt into declaritive binding despite the fact that MVCs are default allow**....'_  


  
In a way Microsoft's (and Spring's) decision to chose the insecure default (see Spring [MVC Autobinding Vulnerability](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/current-o2-support-for-analyzing-spring.html)) is probably the correct business decision. 

  


Choosing the secure alternative, would introduce a hit to development (Joshbw thinks this would be marginal, but I'm not so sure), which these Framework developers felt could create a bad user experience (their users are the developers) and could potentially drive away users into other frameworks that had such 'by default' AutoBinding features.

  


This is why I say that [We need Security-focused SAST/Static-Analysis rules](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/we-need-security-focused-saststatic.html) so that we can deal with the cases where AutoBinding creates vulnerabilities.

  


In fact, a good example of security adding value to developers would be if those SAST rules (via an security engine) would actually automatically introduce those 'Declarative Bindings' without requiring a developer's intervention (this could happen behind the scenes , 'invisible' to a developer, unless that was creating business impact (i.e. side-effect).

  


To see an example of what this could look like, take a look at [The future of secure code? Fixing/Encoding .NET code in real time (in this case Response.Write)](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/future-of-secure-code-fixingencoding.html) 

  


On the commercial SAST front, as far as I know, only [Armorize ](http://armorize.com/)ventures into this 'code fixing territory'
