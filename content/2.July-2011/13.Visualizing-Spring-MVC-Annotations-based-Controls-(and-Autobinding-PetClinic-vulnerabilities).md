## Visualizing Spring MVC Annotations based Controls (and Autobinding PetClinic's vulnerabilities)

If you want to use O2 on Spring MVC apps that use Annotation-Based controllers, there is an O2 module that you can use which will allow you to view/test those controllers (including the Autobinding elements)

  
Here is a blog post that shows how it works: [Visualizing Spring MVC Annotations based Controls (and Autobinding PetClinic's vulnerabilities)](http://o2platform.wordpress.com/2011/07/19/visualizing-spring-mvc-annotations-based-controls-and-autobinding-petclinics-vulnerabilities/)

This is quite an old O2 module (using the previous GUI), but what I really like about it, is that **it shows how static analysis can be used to drive black box tests** (which is the best way to perform blackbox reviews).

  


What we really need next, is to convert this code into the new 'O2 Script based world' and into the Spring MVC mappings classes (as shown in the JPetStore example).
