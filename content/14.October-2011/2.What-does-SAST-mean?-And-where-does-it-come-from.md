## What does SAST mean? And where does it come from?

After I posted [Why doesn't SAST have better Framework support (for example Spring MVC)?](http://diniscruz.blogspot.com/2011/10/why-doesnt-sast-have-better-framework.html) I received the question **_"What is SAST?"_** (which is a valid question since a [Google search today for SAST](http://www.google.co.uk/search?gcx=c&ie=UTF-8&q=Sast) returns some hilarious answers)

**SAST **means **Static Analysis Software Testing** , and (I believe) it was originally coined by Gartner when they published their [Magic Quadrant for Static Application Security Testing](http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=208743) report (first version in 2009).

SAST is basically what we usually (in the web world) call** Static Analysis of source code** (i.e. White Box tools). It cousin is DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) and is what we call Pentesting (i.e. BlackBox tools). [Google's DAST search results](http://www.google.co.uk/search?gcx=c&ie=UTF-8&q=DAST) are also funny. Here is a more detailed answer on the [difference between SAST and DAST](http://www.linkedin.com/answers/technology/software-development/TCH_SFT/459265-20933858).

As you will seen in Gartner's website, they change for this report, but some companies have bought them and posted/leaked the PDF online (in a way that Google finds it)

  * 1st edition: 6 February 2009 [here](http://www.dragoslungu.com/public/GartnerMQ_StaticApplicationSecurityTesting.pdf)
  * 2nd edition: 13 December 2010: [here](http://www.rainasolutions.com/docs/veracode/En/Gartner%20Magic%20Quadrant%20for%20Static%20Application%20Security%20Testing.pdf) and [here](http://imagesrv.gartner.com/media-products/pdf/reprints/ibm/external/volume6/article2.pdf) (linked from [http://www-01.ibm.com/software/rational/info/gartner-security/](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/rational/info/gartner-security/))

Here are couple other blog entries about this:

Back on the topic of Framewoks, Neil MacDonald (from Gartner) is absolutely spot on in this 2009 entry: [For Static Application Security Testing, Frameworks Matter](http://blogs.gartner.com/neil_macdonald/2009/08/21/for-static-application-security-testing-frameworks-matter/) 

  


Btw, I wonder when will the [O2 Platform](http://o2platform.com/) be included in a Gartner Magic Quadrant report?
