## Packaged Spring MVC Security Test Apps: JPetStore and PetClinc

If you are looking to learn about Spring MVC Security, one of the best places to start are the test applications that are included with Spring MVC since they contain a number of Security Vulnerabilities that are common in Spring MVC apps (namely [the AutoBinding vulnerabilties](http://diniscruz.blogspot.com/2011/07/two-security-vulnerabilities-in-spring.html))

The JPetstore files can be downloaded from:  [jPetStore - O2 Demo Pack.zip](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Demo_Files/jPetStore - O2 Demo Pack.zip) 

The PetClinic files can be downloaded from [jPetClinic - O2 Demo Pack.zip](http://s3.amazonaws.com/Demo_Files/jPetClinic - O2 Demo Pack.zip)

This version of the JPetStore O2 Demo Pack already contains a couple \*.H2 files which help with the security testing (PetClinic will soon have them)
